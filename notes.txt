BRANCHING
- View branches
> git branch

- Create a branch
> git branch <branch_name>

- switch to different branch
> git switch <branch_name>

- Create and switch to new branch
> git switch -C <branch_name>

- rename existing branch
> git branch -m <old branch_name> <new branch_name>

- Delete a branch (force delete using -D)
> git branch -d <branch_name>

- Comparing branch 
    - Commits that are in branch_name2 but not in branch_name1
    > git log <branch_name1>..<branch_name2>
    - Comparing changes
    > git diff <branch_name1>..<branch_name2>
    - View only files changed
    > git diff --name-only <branch_name1>..<branch_name2>
    > git diff --name-status <branch_name1>..<branch_name2>

- Stashing changes
(By default, stash doesn't save untracked files, to include them in stash, use --all)
> git stash push -m "<msg>"
> git stash push --all -m "<msg>"

- List stash
> git stash list

- Show changes from stash
> git stash show stash@{#}
> git stash show #

- Apply stash changes
> git stash apply #

- Delete stash
    - drop stash by number
    > git stash drop #
    - drop all stash
    > git stash clear

- Merging branch
> git merge <branch_name>

- Merging branch without fast-forward even if its available
> git merge --no-ff <branch_name>

- Viewing merged and unmerged branches
> git branch --merged
> git branch --no-merged

- Cancel merge 
> git merge --abort

- Undo faulty merge
    - removing last commit (local only)
    > git reset --hard HEAD~1
    - new commit reverting changes
    > git revert HEAD
    > git revert -m <parent> HEAD 

- Squashing commit
> git merge --squash <branch_name>
The above statement will add files to STAGING AREA

- Rebasing (local only)
>> go to feature branch and
> git rebase <master>
>> in case of conflict, resolve it and 
> git rebase --continue
>> other options --skip, --abort

- Cherry Picking
> git cherry-pick <commit_id>

- Picking file from one branch to another
> git restore --source=<from branch> <filename>
OR 
> git restore --source=<from branch> -- <filename>
